# Python Data Structures and Strings

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating fundamental concepts related to dictionaries and list slicing.


## Task 1: Student Marks Lookup Using Dictionary

This program works with a dictionary where:

* Student names are used as keys.
* Their corresponding marks are stored as values.

**Functionality:**

* Prompts the user to input a student's name.
* Retrieves and displays the marks for that student.
* If the student’s name is not found in the dictionary, displays an appropriate message informing the user.


## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

This program demonstrates list slicing operations by:

* Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
* Extracting the first five elements from the list.
* Reversing these extracted elements.
* Printing both the extracted list and the reversed list.


## How to Use

* Run the first program to perform student marks lookup by entering a student’s name when prompted.
* Run the second program to see how list slicing and reversing work in Python.
